Introduction
INTRODUCTION
OVERVIEW
This document specifies the structure of the public RLC messages for the Tehran Stock Exchange.
RLC messages are used to disseminate the public market data to Brokerage firms and Vendors.
It completes the SLE Message Specifications document that provides the private SLE messages
used for the communication between the Central Trading Engine and the Brokerage firms.
RLC messages are sent by the following applications:
•RCE (Reference Data and Corporate Event), the application managing the market reference
database that supports trading at a financial exchange;
•NSC®, the trading engine;
•TCS, the OTC engine;
•PFI2, the index management system.
Structure of the document
The first chapter provides the structure of the RLC messages.
The next chapter, Glossary, provides the definition of every field used in the structures of the
message, including their possible values, dependencies and the messages referencing
them.
To ease the navigation in the document, you may use the active links as follows:
click on any field in a message structure to jump to its definition in the glossary
click on any message or field reference in the definition of a field to jump to the
corresponding message structure or field definition.
Hit the Alt+Left arrow keyboard shortcut to return to the previous position in the document.
Conventions
The type of a field can be one of the following:

Meaning
XAlphanumerical
NNumerical
BBinary
Some message structures have a variable length (for example RLC-04 – Best Limits). This depends
on the number of occurrences of one of several fields or field aggregates. In that case, the “Occ.”
column in the structure table of the message provides the maximum number of occurrences of such
data.

Processing rules
The RLC-04 – Best Limits message is broadcast as changes occur to the order books of an
instrument. For each of the 5 best limits on each side, it shows:
●the number of orders at that level (limit);
●the total quantity of orders at that level;
●the price.
This message is broadcast as soon as something changes in these five best limits. In pre-opening
mode, an additional occurrence is broadcast in the message called Market summary.
The concept of market summary for an instrument
The Market summary for an instrument is the summary of the orders that would be executed if the
Opening of the instrument took place at the moment this message was sent. The market summary
has no meaning except when the TOP (Theoretical Opening Price) has been determined during the
Pre-opening phase.
Orders participating in the calculation of the best limits
Non-triggered Stop orders are not included is the RLC-04 – Best Limits message. To minimize the
message length, only the modified limits (Bid and Ask) are broadcast.
In pre-opening mode, if a Theoretical Opening Price (TOP) is determined:

RLC Messages
Message Structures
•the first occurrence contains the Market Order (MO) limit if it exists
•the second occurrence contains the Market On Opening (MOO) limit if it exists
•the third occurrence contains the price overridden limit at the TOP
•the sixth occurrence is the sum of the MO limit, the MOO limit and total price overwrites. If
the sixth occurrence is equal to the first one (no buy or sell "Market Order" and no buy or sell
"Market On Opening" orders for an instrument) it is not filled in and its corresponding flag in
ITabModMeLim is set to "0".
In Continuous Trading mode, the sixth element is meaningless and the corresponding change flag in
ITabModMeLim is set to "0".
Best Limits sent when the order book is modified
In order to minimize the size of RLC-04 – Best Limits messages, only the best limits that have been
modified or deleted are sent. The market summary is only present during the Pre-Opening phase.
The RLC-04 – Best Limits message therefore has a variable length. The presence in the message of
modified or deleted best limits and of the market summary is indicated via a table (ITabModMeLim)
with 6 Boolean flags:
•flags 1 to 5 indicate whether or not the best limit for rank 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 respectively is
present in the message;
•flag 6 indicates whether the market summary is present.
Caution: It is important to note that, except by chance, the position of a best limit in the message
does not correspond to its rank in the order book, because not all best limits in the book appear in
the message: the first limit present in a given occurrence of the Best Limits message can for
example correspond to the limit with a rank of 3 in the order book.
The relative order of the best limits in the message is the same as the relative order of the best limits
in the book; thus, the rank N in the order book of the best limit that has the position X in the
message is equal to the position in the flags table of the Xth flag that has the value of 1. For example,
if the flags are 001000, this means that there is only one best limit in the message and its rank is 3.

Preparation for the Session
At the beginning of a new trading session, for each instrument whose order book has been modified
by Post-Session processing (elimination of orders in the order book after a corporate event or after
the expiration of a derivative instrument or after the order validity date has been reached), a RLC-04
– Best Limits message is sent.
Entry, modification, cancellation of an order during the Pre-Opening
For each order (except non triggered Stop orders) which modifies one of the values associated with
the five best limits of the instrument (quantity, number of orders, price), a RLC-04 – Best Limits
message is sent.
Opening of an Instrument with Its Group
For each instrument for which a TOP has been determined that falls within the price thresholds, a
RLC-04 – Best Limits message is sent.
Opening/Auction of an Instrument
Same as Opening of an Instrument with Its Group.
Modification of the Last Adjusted Closing Price
Tehran Stock Exchange
Page 14 of 175Public Message Specifications
NSC V900 Series
RLC Messages
Message Structures
The modification of the last adjusted closing price can cause the recalculation of the theoretical
opening price because of an update to the static reference price, and therefore can also result in the
modification of the best limits whose prices are overwritten by the theoretical opening price.
Consequently, if the instrument group is in Pre-Opening, or if the instrument is suspended or
reserved, a RLC-04 – Best Limits message is sent.
Order Entry and Processing During Continuous Trading
For each order entered into the order book, modified or cancelled, if one of the values associated
with the best limits for the instrument is modified (in particular, if a trade modifies the cumulative
displayed quantities), a RLC-04 – Best Limits message is sent.
Modification of the Static Reference Price and the Static Authorized Price Fluctuation for an
Instrument
The modification of the static reference price can cause the recalculation of the theoretical opening
price and therefore a modification of the best limits.
Immediate Rebroadcasting of the Best Limits
For each instrument affected by the command (for a given instrument or all instruments in a group or
all instruments): a RLC-04 – Best Limits message is sent, with the 5 best limits provided if they exist,
and the market summary is provided if appropriate.
Elimination of All Orders for an Instrument
A RLC-04 – Best Limits message is sent.
Cancellation of All Orders for a Member
For each instrument for which at least one of the 5 best limits is affected, a RLC-04 – Best Limits
message is sent.
Elimination of All Orders for a Group
(orders whose timestamps are later than a time specified in the command)
For each instrument for which at least one of the 5 best limits is modified, a RLC-04 – Best Limits
message is sent.

Purging of the Orders for a Member (command entered by Market Control at the request of

Best Limits message is sent.
Effect of "box carrying" on the conditions for sending the message:
Certain versions of NSC® use a technical mechanism called box carrying, which is designed to
optimize performance and to reduce the number of RLC-04 – Best Limits messages sent. This
mechanism modifies the conditions for sending message that were described above, but only for the
NSC® functions Order Entry, Modification, and Cancellation of an Order during Pre-Opening, and
Order Entry and Processing during Continuous Trading.
When the mechanism is used, the receiving processes (HIP) collect the orders received from the HUB
in a buffer memory called a "box," before sending ("carrying") them to the order processing
processes. When an NSC® order processing process is free, the process asks the HIP (Hub Input
Process) that feeds it to send the next box, whether the next box is full or not. When the process has

finished processing the orders for the same instrument in a given box, the new state of the 5 best
limits for this instrument is compared with the state of the 5 best limits before processing. A Best
Limits message is sent if there is a difference.
Note: The maximum size of boxes is configurable for each HIP. Like order processing processes,
boxes are multi-instrument.

The Start of Session message indicates the start of a system at the beginning of a new trading
session. More precisely, this message announces, at the beginning of each new trading day, that the
system is starting its activity of sending RLC messages.
As a general rule, each system that sends RLC messages sends 0 or 1 start of session message per
trading day. However:
•NSC® sends one start of session message per trading unit;
•the sending of such a message is optional (some system do not send it).
The End of Session message indicates the end of the Trading session and that no more messages
will be sent except the following messages:
•RLC-A3 – Market Sheet
•RLC-AO – Start / End of Market Sheet Broadcasting

Management of start of session for trading day
The start of session management process sends a starting message to the broadcasting process. It
then sends all messages generated by "Post-Session" processing during post-session.
Changeover the group of instrument's status
The session management process sends an End of Session message as soon as all the non-
forbidden groups of instruments have switched to post-session state (End-of-Day Inquiries).
PFI2 Transmission Functions
The PFI2 application sends 1 type-07 message per trading day. This message is sent by the start-of-
day batch processes, which are started at a specific configurable time (currently, 6:15 am CET). This
message precedes all other RLC messages sent by PFI2.
the PFI2 application sends 1 type-08 message per trading day. This message is sent by the end-of-
day batch processes, which are started when all the following conditions are met:
1. the earliest time for starting end-of-day batch processes has been reached (a configurable
time).
2. the Cash Instruments Reference Data coming from RCE has been processed.
3. all indices are closed (and therefore all type-B2 messages have been sent).

Post-Session
During the Post-Session processing, static thresholds may be recalculated for some groups of
instruments from the previous day's adjusted closing price.
Opening a group of instruments
Static thresholds may be recalculated during the instruments group opening processing with respect
to the reference price. The latter is updated:
•Either on the basis of the Theoretical Opening Price, if valid,
•Or on the basis of the crossed threshold if the Theoretical Opening Price lies outside the
static thresholds.
The new static thresholds may or may not be broadcast, depending on the group of instruments
concerned.
Changes in static thresholds
Modifications to static thresholds may or may not lead to the broadcasting of an RLC-37 – Static
Thresholds message, depending on the group of the instrument concerned.
Changes in instrument tick limit
Any modification of the static tick limit leads to a recalculation of static thresholds and possibly a
broadcast to that effect.

Processing rules
This message, which is sent by NSC®, indicates the deletion of an order for an instrument. This
processing concerns any order type except Stop orders. Indeed, Stop orders are not broadcast to the
market participants until their triggering, thus it is not necessary to broadcast an RLC-A4 – Delete N
Lines message in case of Stop order deletion.
This message makes it possible for the market participants to realign their order book by indicating
orders that should be deleted.
Three types of deletion are possible (YSupOm):
•Type 1: deletion of an order
•Type 2: deletion of all orders for a given side (buy or sell) starting with the referenced order
•Type 3: deletion of all orders for the instrument
The referenced order identification (entry date DSaiOm and sequence number NSeqOm) and side
ISensOm are provided to allow the message addressee to process the deletion in the market sheet.

The Bid or Offer for an instrument for which there is an unfilled bid or offer. This message is sent only
when the order book for the instrument is unbalanced.
If the Opening Price varies and no new Theoretical Opening Price can be determined and if there are
Market orders orders that are not entirely filled, then:
•If the Market orders are on the sell side, an RLC-A6 – Display of Bid or Offer (offer) message
is sent (Trend Flag = 03 and Price = Lower price threshold)
•If the Market orders are on the buy side, an RLC-A6 – Display of Bid or Offer (bid) message is
sent (Trend Flag = 02 and Price = Upper price threshold.
If the Opening Price varies and the new determined Opening Price lies outside the instrument's
thresholds, then:
•If the determined Opening price is greater than the upper price threshold, a RLC-A6 –
Display of Bid or Offer (bid) message is sent (Trend Flag = 02 and Price = Upper price
threshold)
•If the determined Opening price is less than the lower price threshold, a RLC-A6 – Display of
Bid or Offer (offer) message is sent (Trend Flag = 03 and Price = Lower price threshold).
If the previous Theoretical Opening Price was indeterminate because of unfilled Market orders and
the new Theoretical Opening Price lies outside the thresholds, or inversely, then the RLC-A6 – Display
of Bid or Offer message is sent, even if it has not changed side:
•If the Market orders are on the sell side, an RLC-A6 – Display of Bid or Offer (offer) message
is sent (Trend Flag = 03 and Price = Lower price threshold)
•If the Market orders are on the buy side, an RLC-A6 – Display of Bid or Offer (bid) message
is sent (Trend Flag = 02 and Price = Upper price threshold)
•If the determined opening price is greater than the upper price threshold, an RLC-A6 –
Display of Bid or Offer (bid) message is sent (Trend Flag = 02 and Price = Upper price
threshold)
•If the determined opening price is less than the Lower price threshold, an RLC-A6 – Display
of Bid or Offer (offer) message is sent (Trend Flag = 03 and Price = Lower price threshold).
A Display of Bid or Offer message is often accompanied by an RLC-04 – Best Limits message,
whereas a Best Limits message may be sent even without a Display of Bid or Offer message.

For stock indices
This message handles the real-time characteristics of an index: the level of the index or of the
forerunner, variations in the index level, type of index level (first, real-time, forerunner,...), and various
indicators for the instruments that make up the index.
For ETF - Index Estimate indices and ETF- Indicative NAV (indicative Net Asset Value) indices
This message handles in real-time the "intraday" (indicative) Net Asset Value of an ETF-type
instrument (Exchange-Traded Fund).
There are two formulas for calculating the "intraday" (indicative) Net Asset Value of an ETF:
•One formula is based on the real-time price of the instruments that make up the ETF fund;
this formula is called the Indicative NAV index,
•The other formula is based on the real-time level of the stock index for which the ETF tries to
duplicate the performance; this formula is called the Index Estimate.
The Index Estimate formula is used as a backup so that an intraday NAV can continue to be
broadcast when prices of instruments are not available.
The PFI2 application uses the type-B1 message to broadcast the intraday indicative Net Asset Values
of ETFs. In these messages, the ETF is identified by its ISIN code and its mnemonic code (the
"intraday codes" of the ETF). These "intraday" codes are not the same as the ISIN code and
mnemonic code of the ETF as a listed security in NSC® (an explicit link must be managed between
these two instruments). It should also be noted that, in PFI2, two indices are configured for each ETF:
one uses the Index Estimate calculation formula, the other uses the Indicative NAV formula. The
index manager configures whether one or the other is broadcast (or the two simultaneously). The
ISIN and mnemonic codes are identical for the two indices that are associated with the same ETF.
Thus, viewed from the outside, it is not possible to distinguish between type-B1 messages that send
Indicative NAVs from type-B1 messages that send Index Estimates.
Transmission Functions
The sending conditions and the nature of type-B1 messages that are sent for each index are
dependent on two factors: the broadcast mode of the index, and the current calculation phase of the
index. These two factors are explained below.
Broadcast mode
There are three broadcasting modes for type-B1 messages:
•CONTINUOUS: Calculated index levels are broadcast periodically, at a frequency that can be
configured for each index. The frequency must be a multiple of the base calculation
frequency (15 seconds).
•DISCONTINUOUS: a single broadcast during the day, occurring at a time (a "fixed time") that
can be configured for each index.

RLC Messages

AT CLOSING only: no broadcast during the day.
The conditions for sending type-B1 messages for each of these three modes are described below.
Calculation phases of an index
The type of index level (expressed in the data item CNivIdx) contained in a type-B1 message depends
on the current calculation phase of the index. During the day, every index passes successively
through the following phases:
•
PRE-OPENING phase
The index enters the Pre-Opening phase as soon as one of three conditions occurs (for a
given index, the three conditions are mutually exclusive):
•
•the weight (in the previous day's reference capitalization of the index) of the instruments
for which PFI2 has received a theoretical opening price (an NSC ® RLC-30 – Theoretical
Opening Price message) is greater than a threshold that has been configured,
•the number of instruments in the index for which PFI2 has received a theoretical
opening price is greater than a threshold that has been configured,
•the time for passing into the Pre-Opening phase has arrived.
OPENING phase
The index enters the Opening phase as soon as one of three conditions occurs (for a given
index, the three conditions are mutually exclusive):
•
•the weight (in the previous day's reference capitalization of the index) of the instruments
for which PFI2 has received an opening price (an NSC ® RLC-32 – Opening Summary
message, Opening Summary) is greater than a threshold that has been configured,
•the number of instruments in the index for which PFI2 has received an opening price is
greater than a threshold that has been configured,
•the time for passing into the Opening phase has arrived.
CONTINUOUS TRADING phase
The index enters the Continuous Trading phase as soon as one of three conditions occurs
(for a given index, the three conditions are mutually exclusive):
•
•the weight (in the previous day's reference capitalization of the index) of the instruments
for which PFI2 has received a price (NSC® RLC-32 – Opening Summary or RLC-02 –
Trade messages) is greater than a threshold that has been configured,
•the number of instruments in the index for which PFI2 has received a price is greater
than a threshold that has been configured,
•the time for passing into the Continuous Trading phase has arrived.
PROVISIONAL CLOSING phase
The index enters the Provisional Closing phase as soon as one of two mutually exclusive
conditions occurs:
•
•PFI2 receives a group state message indicating the end of the Market Control
Intervention phase for each instrument group that has an instrument in the index; that
is, an NSC® RLC-16 – Group State Change message with the group state code = F (End-
of-Day Inquiries); this condition of course applies only to instruments traded on NSC®.
•the time for passing into the Provisional Closing phase has arrived.
FINAL CLOSING phase
The index enters the Final Closing phase after being in the Provisional Closing phase for a
configurable period of time, which depends on the index.

Indices in CONTINUOUS broadcast mode
•In the morning, during the start-of-day batch processing (around 7:30 am): For each index,
PFI2 sends a type-B1 message with CNivIdx=5 (reference closing index) and the value of the
previous day's reference closing index. If an index is not treated (no trade from NSC ®) and if
the index has been declared with the parameter “broadcast not treated index” set to YES,
the B1 messages will be generated with CNivIdx=‘Z’.
•While the index is in the Pre-Opening phase, if the Calculate Forerunner flag is set to Yes,
every X seconds (X being a parameter of the index level): sending of a type-B1 message with
CNivIdx = 8 (pre-opening forerunner).
•While the index is in Opening phase, if the Calculate Forerunner flag is set to Yes, every X
seconds: sending of a type-B1 message with CNivIdx = 3 (real-time forerunner).
•When the index enters the Continuous Trading phase, and if the Calculate Opening Index
Level Using Opening Prices flag is set to Yes:
•If PFI2 has not yet received opening prices for all instruments in the index (NSC® RLC-32

•If PFI2 has received opening prices for all instruments in the index (NSC ® RLC-32 –
Opening Summary messages): sending of a type-B1 message with CNivIdx = B
(complete, provisional opening index).

active, sending of a type-B1 message with CNivIdx = the value of CNivIdx set to the
index level for this time period; in theory, the configured CNivIdx should have a value of
6 (daily settlement index level) or a value of 7 (at-expiration settlement index level).

of 2 (real-time index) for a given index (which is in the Continuous Trading phase) can be temporarily
suspended, then resumed. When an index is in a suspended state, PFI2 broadcasts type-B1
messages with an index level of 3 (real-time forerunner), in place of messages with an index level of
2 (real-time index).

Tehran Stock Exchange
The suspension of broadcasting for an index can be initiated:
•Either manually by the index manager (if the index is in the Continuous Trading phase),
•Or automatically by PFI2, when the conditions for maintaining the index in the
Continuous Trading phase are no longer met (see the description above of the
conditions for when an index passes into the Continuous Trading phase).
The resumption of broadcasting for an index can be initiated:
•Either manually by the index manager (regardless of whether the origin of the
suspension was manual or automatic),
•Or automatically by PFI2. Automatic resumption occurs at the moment T0 + P, where T0
is the moment when conditions permit the index to return to the Continuous Trading
phase, and where P is a period of time that is configurable for each index, with the
restriction that conditions for being in the Continuous Trading phase are still met at the
moment T0 + P.

Clearing message for each leg in the strategy.
In trade cancellation messages, all the data items that were provided in the message that described
the canceled trade, are also provided in the cancellation message, including the Trade Number, and
the characteristics of the buy and sell orders.
Transmission Functions
Same conditions as for RLC-01 – Opening Trade and RLC-02 – Trade messages: this message
accompanies and completes either an Opening Trade or a Trade message.
If the trade is canceled, the trading system then sends an RLC-M1 – Trade For Clearing cancellation
message.
These messages are sent in real time.

for a sector index: the FTSE business segment for the instruments that
comprise a given index sample.
According to the FTSE norm, a business segment is composed of three levels:
economic group
sector (whereby a given sector belongs to one and only one economic group)
sub-sector (whereby a given sub-sector belongs to one and only one sector)
Each issuing company is listed in one and only one sub-sector that is
determined according to the proportion of profits earned within the
company's various businesses. The criteria used for each breakdown are
purely economic and make it possible to analyze the issuing companies
beyond their geopolitical borders. A given sub-sector belongs to one and only
one sector. A given sector belongs to one and only one economic group.
In the case of a stock, the aggregate expresses the relationship of the issuer
to a FTSE sub-sector (and, as a result, the links Sub-sector / Belongs to /
Sector, and Sector / Belongs to / Economic group).
In the case of a level 1 sector index (which represents an economic group),
the aggregate expresses the link Index/Represents/Economic Group. The
sector and sub-sector IDs are not provided.
In the case of a level 2 sector index (which represents a sector), the
aggregate expresses the link Index / Represents / Sector. The sub-sector ID
is not provided, and the economic group ID expresses the link Sector /
Belongs to / Economic Group.
In the case of a level 3 sector index (which represents a sub-sector), the
aggregate expresses the link Index / Represents / Sub-sector. The sector ID
expresses the link Sub-sector / Belongs to / Sector. The economic group ID
expresses the link Sector / Belongs to / Economic Group.

This data aggregate describes the structure of the standard header for a RLC
message when the Type of header for RLC message (YTchRLC) in the

In contrast to the RLC message header of type 0, the type 1 RLC message
header has the following characteristics:
•
imposes a specific structure on the first 84 bytes of the message.
•
contains two RLC message lengths: the old N(3) format (which is
deprecated and will become a filler) and the new N(5) format (which
makes it possible for RLC messages to be as long as 99 999 bytes).

uses the ISIN code (X(12) format) to identify the instrument referred

data item.

Code indicating the state of the instrument in NSC®.
The instrument state code indicates the state of a listed security in the NSC®
system, based on two criteria:
•
whether order entry is authorized for the instrument,
•
the trade state of the instrument.
These two criteria are totally independent; taken together, they completely
describe what is referred to as the instrument state.
Role: in the trading system, the state of an instrument determines:
•
the functions that are authorized on the instrument
•
the management rules that are applicable for the order entry and
processing function.
For example:
•
when an instrument is forbidden, no order can be entered on the
instrument.
•
when an order is entered on a suspended or reserved instrument,
the same management rules apply as during the Pre-Opening of an
instrument group.
Integrity Constraints: a value may be provided only if the message was sent
by NSC®.
In messages sent by NSC®, all combinations of values for the first and
second character are possible.

(aggregate)
Adjustment coefficient for the base capitalization of an index.
The number without units by which the base market capitalization for a given
stock index should be multiplied to neutralize the effect on the unadjusted-
for-dividends index level of all change-of-capital corporate events that have
been applied (to the instruments in the index sample) since the date that this
base capitalization was calculated.
If the Recalculate Base Capitalization of the Index flag is Yes, this coefficient
is recalculated by the index calculation system at the beginning of each
trading day J, based on the corporate events effective on day J. The
coefficient is obtained using the following formula:
Coeff J =Coeff J −1×
Cap after CE J
Capbefore CE J
where:
CoeffJ = adjustment coefficient for the base capitalization of the
index, on the given date J
•
CoeffJ-1 = adjustment coefficient for the base capitalization of the

Cap after CEJ = previous day's reference capitalization for index I after
corporate events effective on day J = Sum for all instruments V in the index
sample of the following calculation: Number of shares of V in I after applying
the corporate events effective on day J x Adjusted reference price of V on J-1
x Capitalization adjustment coefficient for V in I.
Cap before CEJ = previous day's reference capitalization for index I before
corporate events effective on day J = Sum for all instruments V in the index
sample of the following calculation: Number of shares of V in I before
applying the corporate events effective on day J x Non-adjusted reference
price of V on J-1 x Capitalization adjustment coefficient for V in I.
This adjustment coefficient can be modified manually by the index manager
in case of an error in the characteristics or in the automatic processing of

Definition
(aggregate)
Capitalization adjustment coefficient of an instrument within an index.
Coefficient used to adjust the capitalization of a given instrument in a given
index.
This coefficient is part of a calculation formula for the capitalization of an
instrument in an index:
Capitalization I  V = PriceV × NumberOfShares I V × AjustementCoefficient
This coefficient is initialized automatically to 1 by the Index Platform
application when an index is created. It can be manually modified by the
index manager. It is not modified by the automatic processing of corporate
events.
Used to modulate the weight of an instrument in an index according to its
"free-float" (number of shares not held by stable shareholders).
Used to limit the relative weight of an instrument in an index, for example to
take into account the regulation of mutual funds, which limits the
capitalization weight of an instrument to a certain percentage of its total
portfolio ("capped index").

Concerning RLC sender data flow (which leaves applications that
send RLC messages)
This data item represents a sequence number that is assigned
chronologically to each message by each process that sends messages to the
RLC message-switching system. A sequence number is assigned according
to the day on which the message is sent, and according to the application
process that sends the message. The number enables the switching software
to detect lost messages. Note that a given RLC message sending application
can have several message sending processes. In this case, each process
assigns a number that is independent of the message number that is
assigned by the other processes in the same system.
•
Concerning RLC receiver data flow (which enters applications that
receive RLC messages)
This data item represents a sequence number that is assigned
chronologically to each message by the RLC message-switching system. A
sequence number is assigned according to the day on which the message is
sent, and according to the application process that receives the message.
This is valid for all sending applications. The number enables the application
process to detect lost messages. Note that a given RLC message receiving
system can have several message receiving processes. In this case, the
message number received by each process is independent of the message
number received by the other processes in the same system.
Role: makes it possible to verify or recreate the sequence in which the
messages occurred, and to determine which messages, if any, are missing.

DefinitionNumber for outgoing RLC message.
The meaning of this item depends on the type of software that sent the
message.
For applications that send RLC messages to the message-switching
application:
A value is to be provided for this item as follows:
•
If the RLC message is forwarded by RLC in real time (and is not part
of a file transfer), the value is 000000.
•
If the message is part of a file transfer, the value indicates the type
of file transferred by RLC to which the message belongs.
For the RLC message-switching system: this is a sequence number that is
assigned chronologically to each RLC message by the application process
that sends that message. In other words, this is the number in the
NMsgInRLC field of the incoming RLC message, which RLC places in the
NMsgOutRLC field of its outgoing message. This number is unique for each
sending application process and for each day.
Role:
•
For real time messages, this item allows the receiving application
process to verify the sequence of messages by sending application
process.
•
For a file transfer, this item allows the RLC system to check whether
the contents of the received file is consistent with what was
expected by the RLC process that is dedicated to processing the file
transfer identified by the RLC file transfer number.

DefinitionAmount of previous day's reference capitalization for the index.
The previous day's reference capitalization for an index is equal to the sum of
the previous day's reference capitalizations for each instrument in the index
sample. The previous day's reference capitalization for instrument V in index I
is calculated using the following formula:
Previous day's reference capitalization for V in I = Previous day's adjusted
reference price for V on the calculation day * number of shares of V in I *
adjustment coefficient of V in I
This amount is expressed in the currency that has been configured for the
index.
Makes it possible for the index calculation system to determine the weight (in
the previous day's reference capitalization for the index) of the instruments
for which the index calculation system has received an opening price, and to
deduce from this, by comparing this weight with the thresholds that have
been configured for this index, the phase changes to be initiated for the
index--between the Pre-Opening, Opening, Continuous Trading, Suspension,
and Resumption phases (see the description of the conditions for sending
type-B1 messages, Real-Time Data for an Index).

Day's last index level.
The value of the last level for the index that is the subject of this message.
The type of index level is identified in the related data item, Index level code
(CNivIdx).
The formula for calculating the index level depends on the type of index, as
described below.
For stock indexes
The index level is calculated from the day's prices for the listed securities that
make up the index sample, using the following formula:
Index level =
NivBas×CapInst
CoefAjCapBas×CapBas
where:
NivBas = base index level, assigned arbitrarily on the date that the CapBas
was calculated (for example, 1000 on 31 December 1987)
CapInst = real-time capitalization of the index = sum of the real-time
capitalizations of the instruments in the index (the capitalization of an
instrument in an index being the product of: the price of the instrument x
number of shares of the instrument in the index x adjustment coefficient for
the instrument in the index)
CoefAjCapBas = adjustment coefficient for the base capitalization of the
index
CapBas = base capitalization of the index = sum of the capitalizations of the
instruments in the index, on the date of the base index level value NivBas.
For ETF- Indicative NAV indexes
The index level is calculated using the day's prices for the instruments that
make up the ETF.
For ETF - Index Estimate indexes
The index level is calculated using the real-time level of the stock index for
which the ETF tries to duplicate the performance.
Possible values

Depending on the type of forerunner, the following instruments are
used in the calculation of capitalizations:
•
pre-opening forerunner (CNivIdx=8): The non-suspended and
non-reserved instruments that have a theoretical opening price.
•
opening forerunner (CNivIdx=9): The non-suspended and non-
reserved instruments that have traded.
•
real-time forerunner (CNivIdx=3): The non-suspended and non-
reserved instruments that have traded.
CapInst = the real-time market capitalization of the index = The sum
of the real-time capitalizations of the instruments (the capitalization
of an instrument in an index being the product of: the price of the
instrument * the number of shares of the instrument in the index *
adjustment coefficient for the instrument in the index). The prices
that are used in the calculation depend on the type of forerunner:
•
pre-opening forerunner (CNivIdx=8): theoretical opening price.
•
opening forerunner (CNivIdx=9): opening prices.
•
real-time forerunner (CNivIdx=3): last traded price.
CapRef= the reference capitalization of the index = The sum of the
reference capitalizations of the instruments (the capitalization of an
instrument in an index being the product of: the price of the
instrument * the number of shares of the instrument in the index *
adjustment coefficient for the instrument in the index). The prices
that are used in the calculation depend on the type of forerunner:

Role: enables the RLC message switching system to verify that the length of
the incoming message corresponds to the length specified by the sending
application.
Although this data appears in the RLC type 1 message header, receiving
applications that process the type 1 header must not use this item. Instead,
those applications must use only the new RLC message length data item (in
N(5) format). The N(3) format message length data item will eventually
disappear from the RLC Type 1 header and will only be used for the RLC
software itself.
Integrity constraints: provided by the system that sends the message to RLC.
Possible valuesUnsigned integer, less than or equal to 999.
For messages having a superior length, the last figure(s) are not reproduced
(for example, if length is 1700 bytes ⇒ ZoctMsgRLC=170).
Deprecated. Please refer to the ZOctMsgRLC5 field instead for the real
message length.

Role: enables the HUB I/A message switching system, and in some cases the
receiving application, to verify that the length of the incoming message
corresponds to the length specified by the sending application.
Applications that receive RLC messages and that process the RLC type 1
message header must use this item, and not the N(3) format length item. The
N(3) format item will eventually be replaced by a filler.
Integrity constraints: none.
Possible values
